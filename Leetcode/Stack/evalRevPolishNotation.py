# You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
#
# Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.
#
# Note that:
#
# The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
# Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
# The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
# There will not be any division by zero.
# The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
# The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
