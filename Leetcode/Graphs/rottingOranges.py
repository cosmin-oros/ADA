# You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
#
# 0 representing an empty cell,
# 1 representing a fresh orange, or
# 2 representing a rotten orange.
# Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
#
# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible,
# return -1.
